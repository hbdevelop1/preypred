/* lines_intersect:  AUTHOR: Mukesh Prasad
 *
 *   This function computes whether two line segments,
 *   respectively joining the input points (x1,y1) -- (x2,y2)
 *   and the input points (x3,y3) -- (x4,y4) intersect.
 *   If the lines intersect, the output variables x, y are
 *   set to coordinates of the point of intersection.
 *
 *   All values are in integers.  The returned value is rounded
 *   to the nearest integer point.
 *
 *   If non-integral grid points are relevant, the function
 *   can easily be transformed by substituting floating point
 *   calculations instead of integer calculations.
 *
 *   Entry
 *        x1, y1,  x2, y2   Coordinates of endpoints of one segment.
 *        x3, y3,  x4, y4   Coordinates of endpoints of other segment.
 *
 *   Exit
 *        x, y              Coordinates of intersection point.
 *
 *   The value returned by the function is one of:
 *
 *        DONT_INTERSECT    0
 *        DO_INTERSECT      1
 *        COLLINEAR         2
 *
 * Error conditions:
 *
 *     Depending upon the possible ranges, and particularly on 16-bit
 *     computers, care should be taken to protect from overflow.
 *
 *     In the following code, 'long' values have been used for this
 *     purpose, instead of 'int'.
